### 2021
- November: I found a mug of the Chilean football team "Colo-Colo" in the kitchen of the Oxford Robotics Institute. One of the most unexpected things I've experienced there so far. [Link (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/mmattamala/status/1458833035231694848)
- October: My colleague David Rytz and I designed a classy, robot-inspired English painting for our former office, supported by some style-transfer and superresolution deep learning: [link (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/mmattamala/status/1448991258404339742)
- June: We did some field trials with the wuadruped robots in a mine near Bath. I took a chance to make some analog shots. [Link (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/mmattamala/status/1400575395309649922)
- March: I was the team lead organizing the CDT Challenge on autonomous exploration at Oxford. It was during COVID, so everything was online, but the teams succeeded in making simulated Jackal robots explore the environment and find interesting objects, like Clifford the dog!

### 2016
- January: I possessed a Japanese robot to had a conversation with the former Chilean president Michelle Bachelet, probably one of the most hilarious experiences I've had in robotics. The government _really_ wanted to have someone speaking Spanish with the president, and somehow I ended up doing it. I didn't make a "robotized" voice as I thought it would be weird, but my voice wasn't the best wither.
