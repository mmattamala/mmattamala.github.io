This is a collection of fun, interesting, or simply random stuff I have been involved in related to robotics.


- May 2025: This was my last month in Oxford. The University of Oxford made a very nice video with our work on forest inventory. I appeared in some shots when we deployed the robot in the Forest of Dean in February 2025. [link](https://www.ox.ac.uk/climate-and-environment/digiforest)
- February 2024: I've been looking into designing LEGO models of robots I like. Bricklink Studio is very fun: [ANYmal C (DARPA edition)](https://x.com/mmattamala/status/1756466704899571719), mini [ANYmal D](https://x.com/mmattamala/status/1756666335231103406)
- December 2023: I was lucky to support the Oxford Robotics Institute team featured in the Royal Institution's [Christmas Lecture 2023 given by Mike Woolridge](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001tv91). I did not appear on screen but I was hiding backstage.
- December 2022: The ANYmal robot ready for Christmas. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mmattamala/status/1603903892336410624)
- October 2022: Crochet attempts of non-orientable manifolds. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mmattamala/status/1584239724373626880)
- November 2021: I found a mug of the Chilean football team "Colo-Colo" in the kitchen of the Oxford Robotics Institute. One of the most unexpected things I experienced there so far. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mmattamala/status/1458833035231694848)
- October 2021: My colleague David Rytz and I designed a classy, robot-inspired English painting for our former office, supported by some style-transfer and superresolution deep learning: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mmattamala/status/1448991258404339742)
- June 2021: We did some field trials with the quadruped robots in a mine near Bath. I took a chance to make some analog shots. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mmattamala/status/1400575395309649922)
- March 2021: I was the team lead organizing the CDT Challenge on autonomous exploration at Oxford. It was during COVID, so everything was online, but the teams succeeded in making simulated Jackal robots explore the environment and find interesting objects, like Clifford the dog!

- August 2018: I defended my master and designed a custom tie for the defense. [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bme-HjOhoVjqm5YrKhAHqOhtmAZxCP24R7Putg0/)
- December 2017: I supported the organization of the International Symposium on Robotics Research (ISRR) in Puerto Varas, Chile. I did not submit anything but it was a really fun experience, met a lot of robotics people and explored the south of Chile as well. [Website](https://parasollab.web.illinois.edu/events/isrr2017/)
- January 2016: I possessed a Japanese robot to had a conversation with the former Chilean president Michelle Bachelet, probably one of the most hilarious experiences I've had in robotics. The government _really_ wanted to have someone speaking Spanish with the President, and somehow I ended up doing it. I didn't make a "robotized" voice as I thought it would be weird, but my voice wasn't the best choice either I must admit.

- August 2015: 4th and last RoboCup, in Hefei, China. First time in Asia after a 54 hours trip from Santiago (included a 12-hours long connection in Mexico). We got the 4th place again, and while we were doing pretty well it was also my time to leave the team and move on.
- January to April 2014: I lived in Victoria, Canada, for 3 months to study academic English. There weren't real robots, but I discovered second-hand bookshops and it was _highly problematic_ when I had to return to Chile.
- August 2014: 3rd RoboCup, in João Pessoa, Brazil. We almost got to the final but we lost against the Leipzig team. The match was pretty tight and we enjoyed it a lot. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EWPkQKHFgU). I designed shirts again. I also met Rodney Brooks and got my books signed.
- August 2013: 2nd RoboCup, in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. First time in Europe. We did a little better.
- January 2013: I did a 2-months internship in the ALMA observatory. No robots, but it was quite interesting living in the middle of the Atacama desert at almost 3000 meters altitude.
- August 2012: My First RoboCup, in Mexico City, Mexico, and first time getting on a plane! I participated with the UChile team in the Standard Platform League. We were (almost the last?) team in the scoring table but I learned a lot.
